Hey there ✌️ I'm Winters! I'm a hobbyist game dev, modder and content creator who also runs a gaming community that focuses on sim racing, rally, touge, and drifting.
</br></br>
Since I was 13 years old and discovered modding for TES III: Morrowind and RPG Maker, I developed a passion for modding and game development. Over the years I have been involved in various modding and development communities for various games, engines and tools.
</br></br>
I enjoy working on projects as a hobby and learning exercise to improve my programming skills or just general experience. These range from small game projects to mods for games like Assetto Corsa.
